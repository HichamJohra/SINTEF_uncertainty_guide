# SINTEF_uncertainty_guide

This Python project is a Dash web app for the visualization, exploration and selection of uncertainty methods at SINTEF Community laboratories of building physics.

This web app mainly consists in an interactive flowchart with links to relevant reports and technical guidelines.

This web app can be used for other uncertainty method selection outside of the field of building physics.

This web app with interactive flowchart can be re-used for other purposes such as complex process visualization, map overlay, ontology exploration, or decision-making tool.
